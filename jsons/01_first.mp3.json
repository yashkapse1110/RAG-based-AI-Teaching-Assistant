    "text": " Welcome to 100 days of code guys In 100 days of code we are going to learn Python Programming from zero to job ready If you have given 100 days Dedicated 100 days Then I will tell you in bite size lesson Python Programming We will take it from zero to advance In starting you will feel How easy it is It is a child's play After that as videos will go ahead We will go till day 100 We will raise the bar like anything We will work on things Which are used in industry It will be very exciting and fun Python is a dynamically typed Object oriented programming language Which was made by Guido van Rossum in 1991 Guido van Rossum was watching a show Called Monty Python Circus When he was working on this language And he thought why not give it the name Python And from then it was named Python In this course we will do a lot of practice Along with theory A lot of exercises and quizzes And a lot of challenges So I will enter my computer And I will introduce you to the Weird and inhumane nature of Python So right now you like this video And subscribe and turn on notifications So that you don't miss any day And you get notifications every day Because it is very easy to get lost in the ocean of YouTube So 100 days of code challenge You all have just accepted Write in the comment section below I accept the 100 days of code challenge Let's get started Intro So I have come here In Google Chrome browser And I will tell you how to download and install Python So as soon as you Write Python, you will come to Python.org And here according to your platform Sir, the latest download of Python Will be found As you can see I am in macOS So for macOS Python 3.11 Is giving I will download it And as soon as it is downloaded You can download your favorite IDE, VS code or anything To use Python in your computer But I will use here Raplet And you can use Raplet This is a collaborative browser based IDE I am using it because I find it very easy To use and along with it Here for me It is going to be very easy to give you code So here I am Sign in with my Google account And after that I will be redirected to this screen So as you can see All my raples have come here Raplet basically gives you an online way To write code If your computer is not fast Or you have a problem Compute wise, that is, your computer Lacks a lot, so you only need A browser tab And you will be able to follow me And because I will use Raplet It will be easy for you to follow me So here I will go to my raples I have already made some raples And I scroll down I will go to the Python 0 to job ready folder And this is our day 1 Raple So here you can see That my video You will see here in the floating pane And here will be our Content and here we will write Code, so the console I will keep it here And Along with that, the code I will show you I will close it here I will write code here And here the output of that code is going to come So I will quickly make a new file here So I will click here And I will open main.py And I want to open main.py here So you see How easy it is to use Here will be the tutorial, here we will write Code, here is the output And here will be Our video which you can watch Now here I have put a demo video You will get to see Our day 1 video If you are thinking that how did I do this So I will give you a link in the description You will know How to do this thing in case A teacher is watching it, so now Let's talk about Python quickly, but before that I would like to talk about What is programming, so as you can see Programming is a way for us To tell computers what to do Computers want to tell us What to do and we do that With the help of programming, if you have a calculator So the calculator is programmed In such a way that we can tell it What is 5 plus 9 Now 5 plus 9 you will say 14, I know this So why should I use a calculator But how about 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 multiplied by 5 6 4 5 6 You can calculate it, but You can't do it as fast as a computer So in this case, a good communication Becomes very important with the computer And for this we use programming The way you and I are talking in Hindi You must be talking to your friends in English You must be talking in Spanish Or you must be talking in any other language To talk to the computer We use programming languages Like Python C C++ Java and many more Programming languages are in the market But this course is dedicated to Python And this is because Python is extremely easy Python is the easiest to learn Programming language because when you Learn Python and then you start Doing things, then it is fun at a different level What is Python It is a dynamically typed general purpose Programming language which supports Object-oriented paradigm and Functional approach also supports If you don't know what are these two We are going to learn in this course It is interpreted, it is a high-level Programming language and Guido Van Rossum Started working on it in 1989 Many people ask When was Python Developed? It was not a day or a year From 1989 to Over the period of years Guido Van Rossum Created it. So many places you will see 1991, many places you will see 1992, you will see 89 But the truth is Starting from 89, it was made over the period of years What are the features of Python The first thing I will tell you It is simple, it is the most simple Programming language, I think this is The best feature of Python And after that you can do anything with it Platform is independent Platform is independent and It means that If you write code in windows Then you can run it on Linux And if you write code in mac Then you can run it on windows You can run it on any platform I am writing code in my browser It has nothing to do with mac Because I am using the Rappler platform But if I write code in my mac You can run it anywhere It becomes very easy for you An open source programming language The biggest thing is that you don't have to pay To use Python which is amazing And Python provides Very big library support So many people use this simple language Because of which All people Are working on some project And all those people's Project, the code written by them The hard work written by them Maybe someone has made something in a year And you can use it in a minute This is very good If I talk from the learning point of view If I talk from the error point of view Then I will say that the error you are getting today Someone came 10 years ago And he has taken out his code And put it on a website like stackoverflow It will be very easy for you It will be very easy for you To find the solution to that problem To find the solution to that problem Python provides a very big library support Then after this It is very easy to integrate it with other programming languages Like C language It can be linked very well Then after this There are some applications of it which I have written here That you can work on database You can work on data science, you can work on machine learning You can make web applications With database Very serious complex applications can be made And to move your business forward You can do a lot of complex Mathematical operations with the help of Python Now I am using Raplet here Because it is very easy to share code It is very easy to install Python Even in local Simply you Why not on any platform You can simply install it Just like a game And if you are in Mac Then the installation is as simple as you are Seeing on your computer screen But if you are in Windows Then you must install Python If you are installing on your computer Then you must check the path variable At Python 3.2 Which is the path You must check it Because if you don't check it Then you may not be able to Use Python from the terminal So if I open my terminal Whether you are in Windows or anywhere And I will write Python Then it is written here that Python is not found So we have to solve this problem too If you are in Linux Or in Mac like me If you write Python Then you will definitely see this error If you write Python 3.0 Then you will see Python RAPEL RAPEL is full form of Read Evaluate Print Loop Here you can use Python as a calculator You can use this type of commands If you don't know What is print statement We are going to study Over the period of days But I want to digest things slowly Day by day So if you want to come out of RAPEL Means if you want to come out of this Read Evaluate Print Loop Then you exit and come out But do you know what I am going to do here I am going to use RAPELIT And in RAPELIT Whatever we make here Files and projects It is called RAPEL And this RAPEL name has come from here Read Evaluate Print Loop which is of Python Or it is in many programming languages So if I write Hello World And click on run So you see it is so easy to run I want to see the output here And why the output has not come yet Hello World Now if I Print 7 or 5 And run it Then it will run here And then I will get to see 5 So basically what is happening here I am writing code here On the servers of RAPELIT And I am getting to see the output here If my computer is slow Then I can run Python very well And I can make new files here I can make new files I can open new files And I can read this text here I can watch this video I can put it wherever I want Or if I don't want to see this video I am practicing something of my own So make it small And make it stand here And make it park here And when you want to see it, make it big So you will have a very good learning experience So I will request you That everyone The playlist of Python which I am going to make official 100 days of code playlist Do access it Like the video and subscribe to the channel So that you don't miss any day This 100 days of code journey I don't want you to miss any day Access the Python playlist Bookmark it and then save it I will meet you in the next video Where we will talk about more good things And day 2 is going to be dedicated On some very interesting things So you guys wait for day 2 And we will meet after that That's it for now guys Thank you so much guys for watching this video And I will see you next time Music Music Music"
